# NOTE

**I'm sorry for the delay.**

**Due to the impact of COVID-19, I'm still not allowed to get back to the lab until now. Because the network of our lab is not allowed from the outside and the whole raw data size is large (more than 30Gb)， I had tried several methods to access the data and finally got the data in few days ago. I need to spend more time to sort out the data, so the data uploaded to this repo is not a release version now and i'm working for this.**

*Although there're some problems, such as un-unified format, current data is usable.*

Thanks very much for your attention and understanding.


~~**THis will be uploaded and documented soon...**~~

~~**Due to the impact of Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), I cannot get back to laboratory and cannot get access to the data. I will upload them after being allowed to the laboratory.**~~
